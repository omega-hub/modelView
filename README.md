Modelview2 is a better version of the model viewer script. Instead of loading models from a pre-set list specified in a script, it recursively looks for 3d models in a directory and its subdirectories, building a file menu you can use to open these models.

Modelview2 also offers a few more controls over object appearance.

### Things to do
- Add support for serializing the current scene (open objects, positions, materials, etc) so the entire scene can be re-loaded
